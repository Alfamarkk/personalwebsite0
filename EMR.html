					<h2>Electronic Medication Reconciliation (eMR)</h2>
						<p>
							Electronic Medication Reconciliation (eMR) is a process by which a healthcare 
							professional creates a comprehensive list of all the medications a patient is 
							currently taking, including information such as the proper route of administration, 
							dose, time, and frequency of the medication, which then compared to the physician’s list 
							of prescribed medications to ensure its accuracy. This is done electronically, reducing 
							errors compared to paper-based methods.
						</p>
					<h2>Goal</h2>
						<p>The goal of eMR is to identify and resolve medication discrepancies, and has been recognised 
						as one of the most important interventions aimed at improving the safety of medication use. 
						This uses a process to compare the medications taken by a patient (including name, dose, 
						frequency, route and purpose) with newly ordered medications. This comparison addresses 
						duplications, omissions, and the need to continue current medications.</p>
								
						<h2>5 Steps of eMR Process</h2>	
										
							<ol>
								<li>Develop a list of current medications.</li>
								<li>Develop a list of medications to be prescribed.</li>
								<li>Compare the medications on the two lists.</li>
								<li>Make clinical decisions based on the comparison.</li>
								<li>Communicate the new list to appropriate caregivers and to the patient.</li>
							</ol>
							<h2>10 Features of EMR Software </h2>
							<ol>
								<li><h3>Patient Scheduling</h3> </li>
									<p> - This includes all the patients’ details and their purpose for visiting 
										the hospital. In some instances, patients may not be sure of a doctor’s 
										specialty, but the details available can help them choose the one that is
										 best for them. Along with it, there are options available through which 
										 patients can receive automatic reminders about their visit. If the doctor 
										 is unavailable on a particular date, they can reschedule their meeting. 
									</p>
								<li><h3>Patient Portals</h3> </li>
									<p> - This includes all the patients’ details and their purpose for visiting 
										the hospital. In some instances, patients may not be sure of a doctor’s 
										specialty, but the details available can help them choose the one that is
										best for them. Along with it, there are options available through which 
										patients can receive automatic reminders about their visit. If the doctor 
										is unavailable on a particular date, they can reschedule their meeting. 
									</p>
								<li><h3>Patient History Recording</h3> </li>
									<p> - This includes all the patients’ details and their purpose for visiting 
										the hospital. In some instances, patients may not be sure of a doctor’s 
										specialty, but the details available can help them choose the one that is
										best for them. Along with it, there are options available through which 
										patients can receive automatic reminders about their visit. If the doctor 
										is unavailable on a particular date, they can reschedule their meeting. 
									</p>
								<li><h3>Medical Billing</h3> </li>
									<p> - This includes all the patients’ details and their purpose for visiting 
										the hospital. In some instances, patients may not be sure of a doctor’s 
										specialty, but the details available can help them choose the one that is
										best for them. Along with it, there are options available through which 
										patients can receive automatic reminders about their visit. If the doctor 
										is unavailable on a particular date, they can reschedule their meeting. 
									</p>
								<li><h3>E-prescribing</h3> </li>
									<p> - This includes all the patients’ details and their purpose for visiting 
										the hospital. In some instances, patients may not be sure of a doctor’s 
										specialty, but the details available can help them choose the one that is
										best for them. Along with it, there are options available through which 
										patients can receive automatic reminders about their visit. If the doctor 
										is unavailable on a particular date, they can reschedule their meeting. 
									</p>
								<li><h3>Order Entry</h3> </li>
									<p> - This includes all the patients’ details and their purpose for visiting 
										the hospital. In some instances, patients may not be sure of a doctor’s 
										specialty, but the details available can help them choose the one that is
										best for them. Along with it, there are options available through which 
										patients can receive automatic reminders about their visit. If the doctor 
										is unavailable on a particular date, they can reschedule their meeting. 
									</p>
								<li><h3>Lab Integration </h3> </li>
									<p> - This includes all the patients’ details and their purpose for visiting 
										the hospital. In some instances, patients may not be sure of a doctor’s 
										specialty, but the details available can help them choose the one that is
										best for them. Along with it, there are options available through which 
										patients can receive automatic reminders about their visit. If the doctor 
										is unavailable on a particular date, they can reschedule their meeting. 
									</p>
								<li><h3>Document Management </h3> </li>
									<p> - This includes all the patients’ details and their purpose for visiting 
										the hospital. In some instances, patients may not be sure of a doctor’s 
										specialty, but the details available can help them choose the one that is
										best for them. Along with it, there are options available through which 
										patients can receive automatic reminders about their visit. If the doctor 
										is unavailable on a particular date, they can reschedule their meeting. 
									</p>
								<li><h3>Centralized Communication</h3> </li>
									<p> - This includes all the patients’ details and their purpose for visiting 
										the hospital. In some instances, patients may not be sure of a doctor’s

							<h2>Benefits</h2>
							<ul>
								<li><h3>Reduced Medication Errors</h3></li>
									<p>- Implementation of electronic medication reconciliation systems that are linked 
									to electronic medical record (EMR) systems have been shown to improve patient 
									safety by reducing prescribing errors and virtually eliminating transcription 
									errors. </p>
								<li><h3>Easy Access</h3></li>
									<p>- Electronic medication reconciliation allows doctors and caregivers to 
										access the patient data in multiple locations, allowing for the information
										 to follow the patient across the entire continuum of care. </p>
								<li><h3>Time-Saving</h3></li>
									<p>- By capturing the data electronically in the beginning of patient care, 
										hospitals can save clinician’s time and eliminate the need for duplicate 
										paperwork. 
									</p>
								<li><h3>Enhanced Communication </h3></li>
									<p>- The eMR drives clearer communication about medication between providers and with patients.  </p>
